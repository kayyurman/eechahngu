This is the first post in a new weekly (hopefully) series I’m title Gone But Not Forgotten. I’ll explore a genre that influenced pop music in some way or another. Today, we’re going to talk about a short-lived but important musical movement called chillwave (or glo-fi, if that’s your thing). --- I’m sure most people here haven’t heard of the great summer of chillwave. And honestly, this post may be more fit for /r/indieheads, but it’s been discussed there many times before, and I think. Слушайте песни Rasmus Faber feat. Frida Sundemo в хорошем качестве.

For all of those who don't know, Northern Canada is relatively isolated to the outside world, at least where i work, I was hired by a private company to observe the climate and the population of animals their, some relatively basic and uneventful stuff. The company is a relatively small and spread out company with a small amount of employees, so at a lot of the camps at, its often times a small building with one person there.

Coan Phillipi run for a 365-405 max. Preface with all the nerd stuff: I’m 19, 6 foot one. I started lifting at the beginning of the summer being about 40 pounds overweight. I did Crossfit five times a week and would run or do something on the weekends. I dropped from 255-210. I still carry a fair amount of fat though. I wanted to get better at CrossFit and lift heavy weights but only had time on the weekends for supplemental work. I stumbled into CP on this subreddit and went for it. Before.

We need a fresh start. To process what happened. The McGowans were a lovely couple. The sweetest neighbors anyone could have asked for. They didn’t deserve what happened to them. No one does, of course, but definitely not them. Especially what happened. I'm trying to get back into the groove I unfortunately lost but it's rather slow going. I'm feeling my way back into what I had planned and unfortunately this wasn't really the ideal chapter for it. Still, I hope I clustered the right words together and that it all feels right!

The following events lie buried in my past like a pebble in the soil. I have swept gravel over them, but it will not take much winkling to pop them out into the sunlight once more. I am of a mind to lay out clearly, before memory’s keen edge grows dull, the circumstances surrounding a sequence of happenings upon which I have thus far forborne to write. Should the facts they pertain to one day become of import or significance, these pages may provide some useful background to the scholar. Invari. Following a hiatus that began in 2000, Phish returned to perform on December 31st, 2002, and continued to play until the last night of the Coventry Festival on August 15, 2004, marking an era in the bands lineage referred to as "2.0". This era has had its quality of play highly debated, and in a fit of stimulant fueled sleeplessness, I decided to write a brief review on every single show, more or less commenting on the highlights of each night. Enjoy! 12/31/02 First show post-hiatus. This is a minimalists' guide to camping-based music festivals. It's based off several years' experience attending festivals across the United States and Canada. There are two main purposes in writing this guide, the first being to help you expand your festival season; that is, to pack the greatest number of fests in the shortest span of time for the lowest possible cost. The second purpose is to offer some thoughts on the nature of festivals and help you to enhance your experiences in natural. TL:DR September 15 was the second anniversary of me starting a complete training routine (2 years ago before that I did around 3 months of shitty half chin ups and push ups to create the habit of working out). In this post I'll link a summary video of what I've achieved this year, some progress pictures and detailed considerations about my training. Also I'm curious if I can be diagnosed with fuckarounditis or if my progress is alright considering my stats (the "progress" section below I work as a paleontologist at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California. Yesterday, I found something I can’t explain. For those of you who have never heard of the Tar Pits, they’re what they sound like. Pits of natural, sticky, bubbling tar that traps whatever falls in. We’ve found the skeletons of mammoths, dire wolves, saber-tooth tigers, and many other animals from the ice age. “I found another dire wolf, Katie,” I called across the lab. I picked

I really enjoyed the process of writing them, and the desire to make another hit me. Death Grips was the obvious next choice, since I’ve been obsessively listening # Prep: For most of the Summer, I ran a Bench-focused, Front Squat-heavy, Deadlift-less version of /u/gzcl's Jacked amp Tan 2.0 (https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/98sgtr/program_review_jacked_tactical_12_weeks_3xweek/) that _finally_ broke my year-long bench plateau and got my TampG Bench up to 135kg (298lb). After that, I tried Greg Nuckols’ _3x Intermediate Bench_ for a bit but noticed that it beat my shoulders pretty badly.

Nic watched from the window on the second floor of the library. He extinguished the lantern which was already at its lowest setting, and touched his nose to the cool glass. The Pagoda, looming tall and straight over the trees, was ink-black against the faintly glittering night sky. The moon was lost behind some clouds to the far left, but there was still enough residual light to silhouette the Pagoda’s curious lines. Something over there had set off the modified herb detector.
